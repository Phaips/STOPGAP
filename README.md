STOPGAP 0.3.1 

STOPGAP is a subtomogram averaging workflow written in MATLAB for performing high-resolution subtomogram alignment and averaging. The source code and compiled MATLAB binaries are included. The source requires the TOM toolbox. STOPGAP is largely backwards compatible with TOM/AV3, and uses AV3-style motivelists and can use AV3-style wedgelists.

Supplied is the source code and compiled MATLAB binaries. Binaries were compiled using MATLAB R2015b. Also supplied with the binaries are bash files we use for running the binaries; we have STOPGAP installed as a module with $STOPGAPHOME as the main directory where STOPGAP is saved. 

Also supplied are example script for running STOPGAP using MPI. The examples scripts are formatted for our SGE cluster.
